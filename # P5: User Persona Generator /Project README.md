# User Persona Generator 🧑

An advanced LangGraph-powered application that generates comprehensive user personas for products and services using iterative processing and structured data extraction.

## 🎯 Overview

This project demonstrates sophisticated LangGraph patterns with **iterative loops** that:

1. **Extracts user types** from input using structured parsing
2. **Iteratively generates personas** for each user type
3. **Creates comprehensive profiles** with 13+ detailed sections
4. **Accumulates results** using annotated state management
5. **Provides actionable insights** for product development

## ✨ Features

- **Automated User Extraction**: Identifies user types from product descriptions
- **Iterative Processing**: Generates personas one by one using loops
- **Comprehensive Profiles**: 13-section detailed persona framework
- **Structured Data Handling**: Pydantic schemas for reliable parsing
- **Accumulative State**: Builds persona collection over iterations
- **Professional Framework**: Industry-standard persona template
- **Flexible Input**: Supports various product types and markets

## 🏗️ LangGraph Workflow

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[START] --> B[Get Profiles]
    B --> C[Get Persona]
    C --> D{All Users Done?}
    D -->|No| C
    D -->|Yes| E[END]
```

### Iterative Loop Architecture:

**Initialization Phase**: 
- Extract user types from input
- Set up iteration counter
- Initialize persona accumulator

**Iteration Phase**:
- Process one user type per iteration
- Generate comprehensive persona
- Increment counter and accumulate results
- Check termination condition

**Termination**: 
- Complete when all users processed
- Return accumulated persona collection

### Workflow Details:

1. **Get Profiles Node**:
   - Uses structured parsing to extract user types
   - Creates list of users from product/market descriptions
   - Sets up iteration parameters (count, counter)

2. **Get Persona Node** (Iterative):
   - Processes one user type per iteration
   - Generates 13-section comprehensive persona
   - Uses counter to track current user
   - Accumulates results in annotated list

3. **Iterator Function**:
   - Controls loop termination
   - Compares counter with total user count
   - Routes to END or continues iteration

## 📋 Persona Framework (13 Sections)

Each generated persona includes:

1. **Header/Basic Info** - Name, role, demographics
2. **Background/Context** - Biography, tech experience
3. **Goals & Motivations** - Objectives and drivers
4. **Behaviors & Preferences** - Usage patterns, preferences
5. **Pain Points/Challenges** - Frustrations and obstacles
6. **Needs** - Feature requirements and expectations
7. **Day in the Life** - Usage scenarios and touchpoints
8. **Quote/Voice** - Representative attitude statements
9. **Personality & Psychographics** - Traits and values
10. **Technical/Environmental Constraints** - Device/network limitations
11. **Preferred Channels** - Communication and discovery preferences
12. **Opportunities/Solution Ideas** - Design improvement suggestions
13. **Measuring Success** - Success metrics and KPIs

## 🔧 Technical Architecture

### State Management with Annotations

```python
class personaState(TypedDict):
    product_details: str
    market_details: str
    aditional_details: str
    users: str
    user_list: List[str]
    user_count: int
    counter: int = 0
    user_persona: Annotated[List[str], operator.add]  # Accumulative list
```

### Structured User Extraction

```python
class Users(BaseModel):
    users: List[str] = Field(description='List of product users')
```

### Iterative Processing Logic

```python
def interator(state: personaState):
    if state['counter'] == state['user_count']:
        return "END"
    else:
        return 'get_persona'
```
